Hyperion aims to have 10k players PvP simultaneously on one Minecraft world to break the Guinness World Record ([8825 by
EVE Online](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/105603-largest-videogame-pvp-battle)). The
architecture is ECS-driven using [Flecs Rust](https://github.com/Indra-db/Flecs-Rust). To contribute,
join [Hyperion's Discord](https://discord.gg/sTN8mdRQ) for the latest updates on development.

Our current efforts are focused on making an event roughly similar to something that would be
on [Overcast Network](https://oc.tc/) (we are not affiliated with them).
