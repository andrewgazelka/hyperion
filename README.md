Hyperion aims to have 10k players PvP simultaneously on a Minecraft server to break the Guinness World Record. The architecture is ECS-driven using [Flecs Rust](https://github.com/Indra-db/Flecs-Rust). To contribute, join [Hyperion's Discord](https://discord.gg/sTN8mdRQ) for the latest updates on development.
