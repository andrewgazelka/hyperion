Thank you for your hard work[^1] [@CuzImClicks](https://github.com/CuzImClicks), [@Indra-db](https://github.com/Indra-db), [@james-j-obrien](https://github.com/james-j-obrien), [@Ruben2424](https://github.com/Ruben2424), [@SanderMertens](https://github.com/SanderMertens), [@Tebarem](https://github.com/Tebarem), and [@TestingPlant](https://github.com/TestingPlant).

Hyperion is a **Minecraft game engine** that aims to enable a 10k player PvP battle to break the Guinness World
Record ([8825 by
EVE Online](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/105603-largest-videogame-pvp-battle)). The
architecture is ECS-driven using [Flecs Rust](https://github.com/Indra-db/Flecs-Rust).

## Event

The upcoming 10k-player PvP event draws inspiration from the class progression systems and [tag mode](https://diepio.fandom.com/wiki/Tag) from [diep.io](https://diep.io/). The gameplay mechanics also draw influence from Hypixel Pit's combat systems. Players will gain levels (XP) from mining ore and killing other players.

We're partnering with [TheMisterEpic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJiFgnnYpwlnadzTzhMnX_Q) to run an initial proof-of-concept event with around 2k players. Following its success, we'll host the full-scale 10,000-player PvP battle alongside numerous YouTubers and streamers.

*= with UNIX sockets, not TCP sockets. Once I get better tests, I will fill in core usage and CPU utilization.

**Test Environment:**

- Machine: 2023 MacBook Pro Max 16" (14-cores)
- Chunk Render Distance: 32 (4225 total)
- Commit hash `faac9117` run with `just release`
- Bot Launch Command: `just bots {number}`

**Note on Performance:**
The system's computational costs are primarily fixed due to thread synchronization overhead. Each game tick contains
several $O(1)$ synchronization points, meaning these operations maintain constant time complexity regardless of player
count. This architecture explains why performance remains relatively stable even as player count increases
significantly - the thread synchronization overhead dominates the performance profile rather than player-specific
computations.

The bulk of player-specific processing occurs in our proxy layer, which handles tasks like regional multicasting and can
be horizontally scaled to maintain performance as player count grows.
