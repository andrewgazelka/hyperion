## Protocol Documentation

We currently target Minecraft 1.20.1 protocol specification:

- **Primary Reference**: [Wiki.vg Protocol (Version 18375)](https://wiki.vg/index.php?title=Protocol&oldid=18375)

## Working with Protocol Documentation and LLMs

Follow these steps to effectively use LLMs for packet analysis:

### 1. Obtaining Wiki.vg Documentation
1. Install the [MarkDownload](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi) browser extension
2. Navigate to [Wiki.vg Protocol](https://wiki.vg/index.php?title=Protocol&oldid=18375)
3. Use MarkDownload to save the page as Markdown
4. Use the resulting file for LLM analysis

### 2. Valence Integration
1. Reference Valence's [packets.json](https://github.com/valence-rs/valence/blob/8f3f84d557dacddd7faddb2ad724185ecee2e482/tools/packet_inspector/extracted/packets.json)
2. This helps map Wiki.vg specifications to Valence implementations

### 3. LLM Interaction
- Provide both Wiki.vg markdown and relevant packets.json sections
- Get assistance with:
  - Packet structure mapping
  - Implementation details
  - Field mapping between specifications

## Getting Help

Multiple channels are available for support:

- **Issues**: Open a GitHub issue for detailed discussions
- **Discord**: Join our [community](https://discord.gg/PBfDtj5Wb) for real-time help
- **Existing Resources**: Check open PRs and issues for similar topics

## Development Setup

### Recommended IDEs

#### Primary IDE
- **IntelliJ IDEA**
  - Recommended as the primary development environment

#### AI-Enhanced Development
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.com)**
  - AI-powered coding assistance
  - Enhanced with [cursor-sync](https://github.com/andrewgazelka/cursor-sync) for IntelliJ position synchronization

#### Additional Tools
- **[Supermaven](https://www.supermaven.com)**
  - Enhanced code completion capabilities

### Code Quality Enforcement

We use pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality:

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. **Setup** (Optional)
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Manual Run** (Optional)
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

#### Automated Checks
The pre-commit configuration handles:
- Rust code formatting via `rustfmt`
- Additional code quality verifications

Hooks run automatically on `git commit`. If checks fail:
1. Review the reported issues
2. Make necessary corrections
3. Attempt the commit again
